# inclass_4

There's three python files in this repository. The calculator.py is the base code that we are testing.
test_calculator.py uses the unittest unit testing framework that was shown in class
pytest_calculator.py uses the pytest unit testing framework, which is very similar to unittest 


To run these programs you must have unittest and pytest pip packages installed in your virtual enviorment. From there just type the run the program from the console or your IDE.
